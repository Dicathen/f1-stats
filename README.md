# F1 Stats

Website to display current year F1 stats + some historical data.

The reasoning to not include total historical data is to respect the [jolpica-f1](https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1/tree/main) API rate limits. This is also the reason of limiting the boxplot comparison to 5 drivers.

## Features
- Current driver's championship standing
- Race information with standings and finish times.
- Boxplot for top 5 drivers' lap times for comparison.
- Driver's list with individual pages with current year stats.


## Todo
- Implement constructor's championship
- Pace differential between top 5 drivers
